Negative,"My common concern in UE Offices is on the Admissions Office since I need to process my enrollment ahead of time because I am an SM Foundation Scholar. There are times that even I process ny requirements early, my enrollment was usually delayed and I need to change my section or subject to take as the slots were already full.
I hope that the process of requirements of those students with the same concern as I have, will also be given time, for them to take the respective subject in their curriculum.
But I still commend those employees who are willing to response regarding my concerns. Thank you."
